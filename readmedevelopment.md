Overview
Shree Ram Delivery is a Flutter-based mobile application tailored for delivery services. It supports two primary user roles: customers who place orders and track deliveries, and delivery personnel who manage and fulfill orders. The app is built with scalability in mind, allowing integration with various backend services (e.g., Firebase, custom REST APIs) and third-party tools for payments, maps, and notifications.
The project is in its early stages, serving as a foundation for a fully functional delivery app. Developers can extend its functionality by adding features like payment gateways, advanced analytics, or multi-language support.
Features

User Authentication: Secure sign-up/login via email, phone, or social media (Google, Facebook).
Order Placement: Browse products/services, add to cart, and place orders with delivery details.
Real-Time Tracking: Track delivery status using integrated maps (e.g., Google Maps).
Order Management: Delivery personnel can view, accept, and update order statuses.
Push Notifications: Real-time updates for order confirmations, status changes, and promotions.
Payment Integration: Support for multiple payment methods (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay, cash on delivery).
Admin Dashboard: (Planned) Web-based admin panel for managing orders, users, and analytics.
Multi-Platform Support: Runs on Android and iOS with a single codebase.
Offline Support: Basic functionality (e.g., view cached orders) in low-connectivity scenarios.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
Maps: Google Maps API for location tracking
Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
Payments: (Planned) Integration with Razorpay
Version Control: Git, hosted on GitHub
CI/CD: (Optional) GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Shree Ram Delivery app locally.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

Flutter SDK: Version 3.0.0 or higher (Install Flutter)
Dart SDK: Included with Flutter
IDE: Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA
Emulator/Device: Android emulator, iOS simulator, or physical device
Git: For cloning the repository
Firebase Account: (If applicable) For authentication, database, and notifications
API Keys: For Google Maps, payment gateways, or other third-party services

Installation

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/trozen04/shree_ram_delivery.git
cd shree_ram_delivery


Install DependenciesInstall the required Flutter packages:
flutter pub get


Set Up Environment

Android: Ensure android/app/build.gradle is configured with the correct minSdkVersion (recommended: 21).
iOS: Update ios/Runner/Info.plist for permissions (e.g., location, camera).


Configure Firebase (Optional)If the app uses Firebase:

Create a project in the Firebase Console.
Download google-services.json (Android) and place it in android/app/.
Download GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) and place it in ios/Runner/.
Enable Firebase services (e.g., Authentication, Firestore, FCM) in the console.
Update lib/main.dart or other configuration files with Firebase initialization.


Set Up API Keys

Add Google Maps API key to android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift (or .m).
Configure payment gateway keys in the app’s configuration files (if applicable).


Run the AppStart an emulator or connect a device, then run:
flutter run

To build a release version:
flutter build apk  # For Android
flutter build ios  # For iOS



For detailed Flutter setup, refer to the Flutter documentation.
Configuration

Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory for sensitive keys (e.g., API keys). Use a package like flutter_dotenv to load them.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_key


Flavor Support: The app may support flavors (e.g., dev, prod). Configure flavors in pubspec.yaml and platform-specific files if needed.
Custom Backend: If using a custom REST API, update the API base URL in lib/services/api_service.dart or similar.

Usage
For Customers

Sign Up/Login: Create an account using email/phone or social login.
Browse Services: View available products or delivery services.
Place Order: Add items to the cart, enter delivery details, and select a payment method.
Track Delivery: Monitor the delivery status in real-time via the map interface.
Receive Updates: Get push notifications for order confirmation, dispatch, and delivery.

For Delivery Personnel

Login: Use delivery staff credentials to access the app.
View Orders: See assigned orders with customer details and delivery locations.
Update Status: Mark orders as picked up, in transit, or delivered.
Navigate: Use integrated maps for optimized delivery routes.

For Admins
(Planned feature)

Access a web-based admin panel to:
Manage users (customers and delivery personnel).
Monitor order statuses and delivery performance.
View analytics (e.g., order volume, revenue).
